Integral SOS
============

Integral SOS is an Android application to receive SMS alarm messages from
Integral-O devices, play corresponding sounds and keep history of events.

This is **NOT 'See All'** application although its user interface looks
similar.

I created this app as my experimental side project when I was working
on 'See All' app at Integral company. Unlike 'See All' this app does not
contain Integral's intelectual property. All SMS messages described in
Integral-O user guide. Media files have references to their owners and most
of them are under Creative Commons License.

I hoped this app could be used as an alternative to 'See All' app in my company
(that's why this app still contains reference to the Integral company). But
this didn't happen and nobody in my company was really interested. So after
about 1.5 year I decided to put it open source. At least it would be kind of
a portfolio of what I've ever done. I have no plans work on it any further.


### Main differences between 'Integral SOS' and 'See All':

| Integral SOS                         | See All                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Backendless                          | Uses backend server                  |
| Can only receive events              | Can receive events and send commands |
| Messages transmitted by SMS          | Uses TCP/IP protocol as a transport  |
